                <div class="faq-trigger" href="#0">Is Send Anywhere secure?</div>
                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>We use SSL encryption on our website https://send-anywhere.com and mobile apps; however, keeping the temporarily generated 6-digit key away from others is important. You can get enhanced security keys – numerical and alphabetical mixtures – through the application’s settings. Sending files through Send Anywhere is completely secure because the files are never stored on any servers. Instead, they are transferred directly via a peer-to-peer network connection between devices. If the devices are in remote locations or in different networks, the p2p path may sometimes fail. In these instances, Send Anywhere finds the most effective node-server to pass through without storing any files. The process for uploading files for later download follows the same convention as a normal upload/download process. The maximum allotted file storage time is 24 hours so there is no need to worry about security.</p>

                    <p>Yes, you need an Internet connection so that the Send Anywhere app can communicate with our servers. Send Anywhere uses whatever Internet connection is available on your device—whether it be WiFi or cellular.</p>

                    <h5>When sending files directly, the transfer path depends on the network connection between two devices.</h5>
                    <p>If both two devices are in the same local network, it’s 100% p2p.</p>
                    <p>If either device is using 3G, 4G, or 4G LTE then it depends on distance, carrier network’s base stations, etc.</p>

                <div class="faq-content">
                    <p>Received music files won’t be available on your native music application. iOS does not allow 3rd party apps to save music files in your music library—you can only do this via an iTunes connection. You can play a single music file received on your Send Anywhere app by previewing it in your “My Documents” tab on the bottom menu.</p>

                    <p>If this is the case, the first thing that you should do is check in your “My Documents” tab on the bottom menu. If you cannot locate it here, please connect your iOS device to your PC via iTunes and look into “iTunes>Device>App>File Sharing>Send Anywhere”. If you still cannot locate it, there is the possibility that iOS does not support the file format that you sent to it.</p>
